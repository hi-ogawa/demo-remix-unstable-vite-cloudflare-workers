Experiment to use remix unstable vite for cloudflare workers.

~This demo requires `serverBuildEntry` option from this PR https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/7975~ (it turns out it's not necessarly, see https://github.com/hi-ogawa/demo-remix-unstable-vite-cloudflare-workers/pull/4)

```sh
# run vite dev server with miniflare to mimic cloudflare workers runtime
# (see app/miniflare.ts imported by app/entry.server.tsx)
pnpm dev

# run production build locally with genuine workerd runtime provided by wrangler dev
# (see app/server.mjs)
pnpm build
pnpm preview

# deploy cloudflare workers
pnpm release
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Remix support for Vite is unstable and not recommended for production.

üìñ See the [Remix Vite docs][remix-vite-docs] for details on supported features.

## Setup

```shellscript
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/unstable-vite-express
```

## Run

Spin up the Express server as a dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

Or build your app for production and run it:

```shellscript
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Customize

Remix exposes APIs for integrating Vite with a custom server:

```ts
import {
  unstable_createViteServer,
  unstable_loadViteServerBuild,
} from "@remix-run/dev";
```

In this template, we'll use Express but remember that these APIs can be used with _any_ Node-compatible server setup that supports standard middleware.
